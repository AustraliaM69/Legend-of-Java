Player Sprite Sheet Information:
===============================

Expected sprite sheet structure:
- File: player_spritesheet.png
- Sprite size: 16x16 pixels (original size, will be scaled by 3x in game)
- Layout: 5 rows x 4 columns = 20 sprites total

Row 0: Idle animations (4 frames)
Row 1: Walking down animations (4 frames)  
Row 2: Walking left animations (4 frames)
Row 3: Walking right animations (4 frames)
Row 4: Walking up animations (4 frames)

Each sprite should be 16x16 pixels with transparent background.
The game will scale these to 48x48 pixels (3x scale).

Note: You'll need to create or obtain an actual PNG sprite sheet file
named "player_spritesheet.png" and place it in the res folder.
